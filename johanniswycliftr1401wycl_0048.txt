XXVIII INTRODUCTIUN.

value besides3 whereas it was generally admitted that by regular
argumentation, still in use now-a-days in many Catholic seminaries,
it was possible to arrive at the truth. In the latter exercise‚ one pro-
position out of the theses publicly sustained by the defendes was
selected 10 be attacked. The opponent affirmed the contrary or the
contradictory‚ and proved his affirmation in one single syllogism3
more were not allowed. The defendes, having denied or distinguished
whichever of the opponent's premises he thought fit, the opponent
had to prove (again in one single syllogism) the proposition denied,
or denied as distinguished3 of course not overlooking the distinction.
This process went on until the opponent had to give up, not being
able to urge his point any further, or until the defender was run
into a corner, and obliged to deny one or another of two self-
evident truths.

I myself have seen a defender, liaving denied that ‘Bellum est
contrarium virtuti morali', met by an argument like this: ‘Quod est
contrarium paci, est contrarium virtuti morali³; atqui bellum est con-
trarium paci: erg0³. Unable to deny the minor, and not very well
understanding the major premise‚ it was the latter he denied. His
opponent had him at once. ‘Si pax est virtus moralis, contrarium
pacis est contrarium virtuti morali . . . etc.2 — A much rnore
skilful antagonist was sorely puzzled at the following: ‘Qui habet
infinite perfectionem creaturae, habet infinite perfectionem meae per-
sonalitatis3 sed Deus non habet infinite perfectionem meae personali*
tatis: ergo.³ The minor, denied, was proved thus: ‘Qui habet infinite
perfectionem meae personalitatis, est plus ego quam ego ipse: atqui
Deus non est plus ego quarn ego ipse3 ergo’. The major was seemingly
easy of proof: for my ego is not a perfectiori possessed infinitely by
me; and the minor⁷ if denied, would have been an affirmation of
Pantheism. Happily for the student, the professor was at hand, and
ready to help him out of the difficulty.

Obligation is a quite different, though not a more easy exercise.
It may be called ‘An Exercise in Consistency³‚ Any assertion was
proposed to the respondent by his antagonist3 and by a common
understanding‚ admitted, if not seIf-contradictory. Then, during the
whole time of the exercise‚ the respondent was to answer as if that
proposition were true, denying any other that was inconipatible
