lv INTRODUCTION.

when the Library is not open to the general public3 but at
last Ι succeeded in getting through the whole of the MS. It is
needless to complain of the crabbed writing‚ which for illegibility
surpasses anything Ι had yet seen, and equals anything I have seen
since, even amongst the worst of the Prague MSS. This is a diffi-
culty which all transcribers of Wyclif will by this time have learned
to take as a matter of course. And yet it is but fair to point out
that in difficult passages, such as abound in Logiccz from beginning
to end, this very greatly increases the perplexity of the editor. More
than once —— and I might say, more than fifty times —I have been
obliged to note down the abbreviations of the MS. with the unuttered
reservation: Unless the sign stands for something quite different!
A reservation that is by no means unjustifiable. When to the utmost
slovenliness of r’apid handwriting are added such stenographic con-
tractions as 95³¹ for consequens falsum (Ι), it becomes the editor’s
duty to point out the reader the real facts of the situation, and the
doubts that necessarily beset the text on every side.¹

Both A and Β are described in the works that have appeared.
l may, however, insert here a more detailed description of Β, which
happens to be at hand3 that of A, which Ι also made at the time Ι
collated and copied from it, has unfortunately been mislaid.

A Ξ MS. Univ. Prag. V. E. 14. Bound in wooden boards,
covered with parchment. The whole of the MS. is of paper, enclosed
at the beginning and end in two leaves of parchment. Before the first
of these leaves, on the inner side of the first board, we find written
in a modern hand: “10 Joan. Viclephi de probandis propositionibus
a folio 1mo usque ad folium 32. — 2³³0 Eiusdem de Hypocrisi [εἰεΙΙ a
folio 33 usque ad folium 176. — 30 Questio de creatione mundi et
utrum Deus in Primo instanti temporis potuit producere a folio 117
usque ad folium 220.³³ ‘Hypocrisi' is evidently a misreading for
Hypotheticis.

The handwriting belongs to the end of the X1V1¹¹or the beginning of
the XVth century3 itis very much abbreviated and veryillegible, especially
towards the end. It seems to have been written in several different
hands; one of them is very flourishy and hard to decipher. It is
