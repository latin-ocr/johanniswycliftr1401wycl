The Four Mam Dicas-{ons Qf Wyclif's Latin Worlcs. 3

history and scholarship generally is that of subscribing ‘to
the W'gyelg'f society and presenting its issues to some Public
Institution. This was done by the late Mr. Samuel Morley
on behalf of ten Theological Colleges and other Institutione,
and all these subscriptione lapsed at the end of 1887. A few
of them have since been taken up by other friends, but the
others in these “ hard times '' know not where to look for

the required assistance.
The Oommittee appeal to all who care for the Religion,

the Freedom, the Language, and the History of England,
for aid in the work they have undertaken. No party feeling
whatever enters into the Society’s plan. The only desire is
to do England's long-neglected duty to the memory of a

great English Worth y.

Wyclif’s Latin works fall under four main heads :—

1. SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY, including the relation of
Church and State, διο. Of this the chief collection is the Summa
Theoloqiae in twelve books (of which half have been issued by the
Society). The rest of the Summa, andos its introduction De Dominio
and De Dominio Βιῗυίηο, will take at least seven 8vo, volumem

2. SERMONS, these have been issued by the Society in four
volumeS, edited by Professor Loserth.

3. EXPOSITION OF THE SERMON ΟΝ ΤΗΕ MOUNT,
Matthew xxiii.-xxv. containing invective akin to Luther's, now
at press, to be finished in 1892.

4. LOGIO AND PHILOSOPHY. The chief treatise in this
section is De Ente. Parts of this, with other treatises in this
section, were copied by Huss, and his autograph copy is still in
the Royal Library at Stockholm. In addition to their influence
on the Bohemian mov-efflent, these philosophica] works are im-
portant as being continually referred to by Wyclif in his later
writings‚ and by his opponent waldon. These will probably take
five volumes, of which the first (Loyz'ea et Loqz'eae Contz'nuatz'o) is
nearly through the prees. Besides these main subjects, there are
two less ones,

5. Pmmsws, Drsrnmnons, AND EPIsTLEs, and

6. ΟΗΠΒΟΗ GOVERNMENT ΛΝΒ Emowmms, which will probably

take two volumes each.
