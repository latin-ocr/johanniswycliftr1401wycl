Terms in the plural, 229; may be subject
or predicate, or both, ib.; the predicate
belongs to each singular that makes
up the plural subject, except in certain
stated caseS‚ 229, 2303 v. g. when
several causes work at a given effect,
the last cause produces the effect as
some say, 230, or rather the verb in
the present is ampliated and ‘makes'
implies the whole of the making in
time, 230, 231; sophists however deny
this, ib.‚- none of these partial pro-
positions concerning a plural subject
are true distributively, 232, only col-
lectively‚ 232, 233.

Time and place represent parts of duration

Truth is the correspondence between any

763 may be contained in false pro-

Two men, with the Universal ‘Man',

Ubi (where) may mean z‘nywhere in the

Ultimate singulars are perhaps impossible
to arrive at, 101.

Unit, the, is the prInciple of the cate-

Universal affirmative propositions, four
ways of proving them, 85; cannot be
converted with their singulars, ib„-

exist only when the predicate is distri-
butived, 86, and the subject not com-
pound, 86, 87; may be proved in-
directly, 87; rule for expounding them,
87; variations in the application of the
rule depend on the gender of the quan-
tifying sign, 88, or the nature of the
subject, 88, 89, if it is disjunct or co-
pulated, etc„ 89, 90, if composed with
an ablative absolute, 90, 91; if con-
taining a genitive case, 9ι; analysis of
the genitive in a subject, 92; variations
in the rule, proceeding from the verb
of the proposition, when ampliated, or
inchoative in meaning, 94, 95; or in-
dicating an intellectual process, 953
difficulties with negative terms in such
cases, 95, 96, rule given when the
universal affirmative has its verb in the
past or the future, 963 sometimes the
strict observance of the rule is un-
necessary‚ 97; how to analyze a uni-
versal affirmative into its singulars, 97,
98; variations in the exposition, pro-
ceding from the predicate, 98, 99.
Universal negative propositionS, proved
in how many ways, 1003 how its
corresponding singulars are obtained,
101; all the parts of its subject and its
predicate are distributed, 1023 it can
be converted simply, ib.; may be proved
by showing its contradictory to be false,
104, or by proving the truth of the
converted proposition, 1053 but it
cannot be expounded, 106.
Universals‚ 13 the word has three mean-
ings, 83 predicable universals: the
genus answers the question, what? for
specieS, 8, 9; the species answers the
