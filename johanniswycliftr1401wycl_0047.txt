contradictories; all which is more fully explained in different parts
of Logicae Continuatio. Chap. XIX has a few remarks about
difference and <otherness>‚ to be developed later.¹ Chap. XX deals
shortly with “beginning³, ‘ending³, and comparative propositions;
all this is completely developed hereafter. 2
Chap. XXI. Of ‘Official' Terms. They have been already defined
as expressing an act of the mind or will on the abstract meaning
of the proposition that contains them. There are elsewhere3 further
developments about the sense of scire, dubitare, &c.; but nothing,
as I said before, that can properly be construed as ‘materia de θεῖνε),
that was promised us in the Proemium. - To expound this pro-
position: ζΙ know that God exists³, we must develop it thus: tThis
proposition, God exists, whose primary signification is the affirmation
of God's existence, is known to me.> We must in like manner
expound similar propositions, such as: Ι understand . . . it is true
. it is false, ἃς. The reason of this roundabout way of deve-
loping them is probably the requirements of argumentation. Suppose,
for instance, that in a public dispute this point had been proved:
eAll men know that God exists’3 the opponent might perhaps protest,
if the defendes suddenly jumped from this conclusion to the other.
‘God exists'. ssut by analysing the proposition, and pointing out
that ‘what is known is true³, and that consequently God exists, one
can easily get out of this verbal difficulty. In their public ‘dispu-
tationes³, the Scholastics used to be particularly severe about all arguments
being in strict, nay, in ultrastrict form. ‘Aliquis homo est mulier'
would have been attacked as implying self-contradiction, aliquis
meaning only the masculine sex. 4
Chap. XXII. Of Obligation (p. 69 —75). This is a curious exer-
cise about which I have not been able to gather anything in modern
works, even of Scholastic logie, nor indeed in any that I have
read. Possibly it was a transient fashion in Oxford at that time. It
certainly served a good deal towards sharpening the wits, and must
have been used mainly for that purpose alone, for it is of little
