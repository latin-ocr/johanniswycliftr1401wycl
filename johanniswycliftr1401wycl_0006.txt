2 The Wyclz'f Society to Publish all Wyelg'f's Latin Worlss.

In Germany Dr. Lechler had printed a few short pieces;
and two volumes of Polemieal T mets, edited by Dr. Rudolf
Buddensieg of Dresden‚ and in part paid for by the King of
Saxony, were adopted and issued as the Wyclif Society's
volumes for 1882 and 1883. We cannot desire that
German scholars and princes should complete the work
which falls by right to Englishmen; and even if we had
reached that pitch of supine contentment it is unlikely that
our wishes would be fulfilled. It is time for us to wake up
from our lethargy, and set our hands mansully to the duty
before us.

The year 1884 was the 500th anniversary of Wx-cm’s
death, and a few men then resolved that the Wqselff Socz'etgs
should be kept on foot until all the Reformer's genuine
writings are given to the world through the Press. Half
of them, or rather more, have since been issued by the
Society. The rest are nearly all copied, and most of them
are in editors' hands, preparing for the press.

If only 400 members can be obtained at a guinea a year

for {hg Society‚ ten more years will probably see the whole

A full English abstract or digest of each of the Society’ s

volumes is given in it, so as to make reference easy to the
student, and to enable the English reader to get a know-

Press and the Early English Pext Society.
