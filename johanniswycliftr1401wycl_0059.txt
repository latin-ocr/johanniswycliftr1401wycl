INTRODUCTION. xxxlx

Exceptive propositions may be turned into universal affirmatives
or exslusives with the same sense. ‘Nothing except Β is C³3 ⁵Only
Β is C³; ‘Every C is B? There are difficulties in making these con-
‘versions‚ when dealing with complex and copulated terms. Wyclif
meets thern very conscientiously, and Ι have followed him as well
as I could in the side-notes. But perhaps the general reader will be
satisfied with the fact, and those who are more curious ought to
refer to the text itself, to which it is impossible to do full justice in
so short a synopsis as this must necessarily be.

Chap. XI. Of the Necessary and tlze Impossible (p. 156—166).
These terms are taken together, because contraries follow the same
rule. <Necessary³ is timpossible not to be’, 'impossible’ is ‘necessary
not to be.³ <Necessary³ is said of what is useful, of God, of any
absolute truth, of conditioned truth, and stands also for ειῃιιεῑ).
Waiving the two first senses as irrelevant, the absolutely necesscny
is either lm, Primordial, i. e. the truth of God's existence3 or 2¹¹³,
Secondary, but sels-necessary; as geometrical theorems; or ΒΜ, What
now cannot have not been: as all past facts.

The relatively necessary is Antecedent, i. e. that of a cause
relatively to an effect3 or Conseqzcent, caused by antecedent necessity;
or Concomitant‚ when it merely coexists with something else. The
same thing may possess all three necessities at once, they are not
even opposed to Contingency. Antecedent necessity is volzmtazy,
natural, or coe'rced. The divisions of the Impossible are similar.

Wyclif then proceeds to expound such propositions; but he
notes that in some cases, ‘necessary' being a substantive, the whole
proposition is purely categorical. When modal, and out of several
senses of ‘necessary,³ one is true, we may grant it, even in such a
case as ‘necessarily something is, which is not necessary)l And we
also grant that something that is not now necessary will be so some
day, when it llas happened3 in this theory it may be that God.
creating me, does not exist; i. e. at any instant of time other than
my creation. It will be true that I have a son; then God is not
creating my son, while He can be so3 therefore, something contingent
is in God.‘-' Yet this is false. -- Ι notice this only to call attention
