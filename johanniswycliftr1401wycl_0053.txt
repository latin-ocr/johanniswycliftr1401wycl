INTRODUCTION. XXXIII

too. <Homo justus et grammaticus³ may mean Ca righteous man 11)le
is a grammarian', or ta righteous man, together with a grammarian³ ;
in the second case, the verb must be in the plural. Punctuation may
also affect the sense; as: <Homo-futurus est³‚ which is false3 and
cHomo futurus-ese, which is true. Such propositions Wyclif calls
partitive, and he adds some remarks on so-called implicative pro-
positions. Ablatives absolute can be turned into incidental propo-
sitions.

The subject containing a term not in the nominative is next
examined and expounded. The rule is that the genitive (or other
case not the nominative) becomes universal in the second or negative
exponent, v. g. ‘Every A of any Β is C Some A of some Β is
C, and no A of any B is not C) This Wyclif proves by analysis
of the proposition. There are, however, cases when this is not true:
as ‘Every servant obedient to lzis master is liked by you. Or ‘He is
the master of an obedient servant.³ If the genitive precede the nomi-
native, then the term that comes first is alone universal.

I must here correct a foot-note on p. 93 that was not suffi-
ciently considered. Wyclif (l. 37) points out that this proposition
is false: eEvery proposition or its contradictory is true3' the reason
is that ‘Every proposition' comprises contradictor-ies too; so the
opposition implied by or cannot be posited.

c) The sense of the proposition varies with the verb. First, if
the verb be in the present, it may be ‘ampliative³ or not “ampliative.³
To ampliate, in the technical sense here followed, means to extend
the meaning to mere possibility or to an intellectual process. Wyclif
says that we must, in expounding such a proposition, give to the
negative exponent the substantive verb, together with the ampliative
one3 as: ‘Every A can be Ρ) Some A is Β, and no A is or can
be that cannot be Β] Or 'Evetv A begins to be Β Some A
begins to be Β, and no A is or begins to be that does not begin
to be Β.) l confess l see no use in all this complexity. But again,
we know too little of the philosophical currents of the period to be
able to judge, or even to be sure that we understand aright. These
precautions may have been a safeguard against some sophistical trap.
Negative propositions belonging to this category (Em 'All that is
not will be or was) present particular difficulty, that can indeed be
