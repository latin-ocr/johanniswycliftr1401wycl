XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

Many fallacies can be solved by such extension of meaning.
‘A bishop (that is to be) will see Socrates, who will never be seen
by a bishop (that is so now)³ &03 the sense of the verb is here
ampliated as to time, ancl that ought to be borne in mind. So of
the other fallacies given on p. 112, 113.

Chap. VII. Qs tlze Particular Negative (p. 116—121). The
salient point of this chapter is a fifth sort of proof brought forward
under the name of captio, and refuted. Wyclif has just said that
‘what is not intelligible to me cannot be understood by me.³ It is
objected that ‘something unintelligible is understood by me,2 since
Ι understand its absurdity. So <1 understand what is not intelligible
to rne.³ But the fact is that we do not know the sense of the pro-
position, for it has none. All we know is that it has no sense. And:
thus the fifth sort, captiozts proof, is valueless.

Second Tractate. Chap. VIII. Of Dzfference and Otlzerness
(p. πει-128). To differ, according to Wyclif, is thus expounded:
<A differs from Β A is, Β is at the same time, and A is not Β.)
There can be no difference, if there be not a certain simultaneity.
Some of the conclusions which he indicates rather than proves are
curious, and remind us of certain modern philosophers. For instance,
the Sixtlz Conclusion.¹ <A man may differ from an ass, but not every
ass would differ from him; for if 'ne differs and they differ at the
same instant, the very fact would prove a certain identity. — Seventlz
Conclusion. <A man may differ from every man, and yet not from
every man past, present, and future.' Ez‘ghtlz Conclzcsion. tA man may
differ from that which is white, and yet never come to differ, nor
even be able to differ from that which is white,' because2 ethat
which is white³ has particular extension, not universal, in the present
tense, and a universal one in the past and future. leatwlziclz differs
is that wlzz‘clz will not differ3 tlmt uslziclz is other than true will be
true. The supposition, it is seen, bears upon the that which, the
mysterious subject of all changes and dirl'erences. Many Hegelian ideas
are 'nere undeveloped, and wrapped up in Scholastic phraseologya
but I think it more than doubtful whether Wyclif ever developed
them, even in his mind. He was carried away in another direction.
