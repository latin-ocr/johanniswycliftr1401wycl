XX INTRODUCTION.

than seven) the comparative hypothetical1 often differs from a cate-
gorical merely in form3 ‘A is more Β than C is’ comes to just the
same as ‘A is more Β than C‘. And Ι believe that all such hypo-
theticals may be turned into categoricals with but little difficulty.

Coming to the local and temporal proposifflons, Wyclif pro-
pounds a theory which is true, and which yet might easily open a
vast field for sophistical juggles. What is meant by where, and
what by when? The general meaning implies co-existence in a
certain restricted part of space or time. ‘He is where I arn³; i. e. in
London. ‘Napoleon Ι. and Cetewayo lived at the same epoch', i. e.
during the XIXtll century. But in the strictest sense, there should be
exact co-existence in the very same part of space or time. Now tvvo
persons cannot thus co-exist in space, ‘nor perhaps in time. On the
other hand, in the widest possible sense, where refers to the whole
of infinite space3 when to the whole of infinite duration, or eternity.
In this sense (to take Wyclif's examples) it is true to say clee sun
is where the moon ῖς), both being in the same universe3 and “I
existed when my mother was as yet a virgin, and when Adam was
in Paradise³3 these three facts co-existing in the same lapse of
eternal duration.

Chap. X. Of Conversion (p. 33, 34), This is putting the subject
into the place of the predicate, and vice versa. Universal negatives
and particular affirmatives may be conver-ted simply, by a mere
change of place. ‘No A is Β No Β is Α). <Some A is Β some
A is Β). - Universal affirmatives and negati-ves are converted bs
accident, that is, by changing the proposition into a particular one.
‘Every A is Β some Β is A'. tNo A is Β sorne Β is not Α).
—- The unixersal affirmative max also be converted bx cour-lter-
position leeping the same quality and quantity, and psefiklng
the negation not to both subject and predicate Every A is Β-
Every not-B is a not-AI ffl And according to scholastic logicians,
even at the present time, the particular negative cannot he otherwise
converted: ‘Some A is not Β Some not-B is not not-A². In a
foot-note I have suggested a simpler process and a less crabbed form
of expressing the result. When Ι wrote it, I had not noticed that
