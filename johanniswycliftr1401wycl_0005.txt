MAY, 1892.

THE Wch Socm‘rY was founded in 1882 to remove from
England the disgrace of having till then left buried in
manuscript the most important works of her great early
reformer, J OHN WYomF. This scandalous neglect extended
over nearly 500 years. Wyolif died in 1384. Not till 466
years after was his English Bible printed. Not till 485
years after did his Seleet Enylish Worlcs appear3 and not
till 1881 were the rest of his ENGmsH works printed.

These publications shew us Wyclif in his purely English
aspect, as the first translator of our Bible and THE FATHER
OF ENGLISH PROSE, but they help us very little to follow the
growth and development of his mind, or to understand his
immense infiuence as the teacher of Huss and the originator
of the Reformation in Europe. ‘⁴ No writings so important
for the history of doctrine are still buried in manuscript‚''
as Wyclif's, said Dr. Shirley 27 years ag03 and their
interest is by no means confined to the theologian. The
relation of Wyolif's teaohing to the later Lollards and to
the social fermentation of his own period, may be mentioned
as one among many matters in which the publication of his
works would be of great service to the historian.

Till the Wyclif Society started, only one treatise of
importance, the Trz'alossns, had ever been printed¹ out of the
great mass of the Reformer's Latin writings. Published
abroad in 1525, and again in 1753, it was edited for the
Oxford University Press in 1869 by Dr. Lechler. A few
tracts (not 100 pages in all) are contained in Shirley's
Fascieult Zizam'orum; and this was all that England had

done up to 1882, to make the chief works of this great son
of hers accessible.

¹ All the works of his chief opponent, the Carmelite Tamus Nnrrnn, or

WALDEN‘ (because he was of Saffron waldem), have been printed over and
over again.
