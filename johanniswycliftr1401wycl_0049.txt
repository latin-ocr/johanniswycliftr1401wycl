INTRODUCTION. XXIX

with it, admitting any that its admission implied, and answering
irrelevant propositions according to their truth or falsehood. The
following instances‚ given by Wyclif‚ may suffice to prove that it
was not always easy to determine when a proposition was consequent
to or incompatible with another, or merely irrelevant.

Evety man is in Rome is the assertion put forward. Thoug'n
false, it is possible3 therefore granted. Then: 'You are in Rome'. —
Denied, as irrelevant and false. -— “Yon are a man³. —— Denied too,
as incompatible with the proposition already granted.

εΥοιι are dea& is not absolutely self-contradictory (though in con-

tradiction with facts), so it is granted. — ‘You are alive’. — Denied. —
cYou deny your own act then³. — No, for if dead Ι have no act at
all, and am not answering you now. — Many will doubtless think

that this custom of consistently maintaining a falsehood to its utmost
limits must have been confusing to the moral sense of truth and
untruth. Ι do not see that is was necessarily 303 at any rate, Wyclif

cannot be blamed for teaching the rules of an exercise which he
found established.

<Some hand of yours does not exist.² —- Granted‚ — CSome
hand of yours does exist.³ — Granted‚ as true and irrelevant. ²Which
hand exists‚ the right one or the left? — The right one. —— <If so,

your right hand is every hand of yours (omnis manus tua)¹; so
every hand of yours exists; which contradicts the first proposition
that was granted. The answer, says Wyclif, is to teny the con-
sequence in this case; or if some hand in this case means evezy‘
hand, to deny that any hand exists.

'No proposition is put to you‘. — Granted. ἡ, ‘Some propo-
sition is put to you.5 — Denied as contradictor-y. a* ‘This proposition
is put to you! - Also denied. The opponent urges: 'l put the
present proposition to you: therefore it is propounded.' -— lt would
certainly follow, is the answer3 but the fact is denied.

These intellectual gymnastics may appear puerile, as gymnastics
generally do3 but Ι think that, owing to the traces throughout Logica
of the importance then given to the exercise‚ Ι could not give it
less space here. It was besides sometimes used for serious questions.
