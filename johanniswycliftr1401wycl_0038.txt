XVIII INTRODUCTION.

tive3 orin quantity, being either universal, designated by omnis ornullus,
as the case may beg or particular, when they are designated by
aliqui83 or indefinite, when preceded by no sign at all3 or lastly,
singular, preceded (when the subject is not a proper noun) by a
demonstrative pronoun.

Chap. Vl. Of Opposites (p. 18—22). This concerns the oppo-
sition possible in different propositions having the same terms as
subject and predicate, and differing only in quality, quantity, or
both. There is nothing new in this chapter, and the ‘square of
opposstion’, given in the diagram on p. 18, is well-known even to
modern logicians. Prof. Bain especially1 has a fuller explanation of
opposition than our author, who devotes less than four pages to it.
What Prof. Bain objects to most, is the use of ‘contradictory³ by
Schoolmen to denote a less considerable opposition than the term
tcontrary³. This, however, is a mere question of words; and if
Wyclif were now living, he might have said that contradictories
(such as ‘Every A is 13³, ‘Some A is not 13³) seem to be less opposed
than contraries <‘Every A is 13³, ‘No A is ss>); but they are really
more so. For the former differ both in quality and in quantity; and
it is impossible, so great is their difference‚ to class both of them
either among true or among false propositions.

We may, therefore, pass over this chapter, merely noting down
the laws stated by Wyclif and all other logicians: (i.) Contraries.²
Both cannot be true, but there are cases3 when both may be false.
(2.) Subcontraries 4 may be both true and both false (‘Sorne A is ss;³
cSome A is not ss’). (¹3.) Contradictories. Neither can both be false
nor both true. (4.) Subaltermztes. If the universal proposition be true,
its particular will be so too, but not vice versa. Wyclif omits to
add: If the less universal be false, the more universal will be so;
but not vice versa (Every A is B³3 ‘some A is 13⁸).

The chapter closes with a few remarks on the predication of
the ‘three adjacents'. If a proposition is in three or more words, it
predicates the third adjacent, as: ‘Man is mortal’. If in two, as:
‘Man is³, it predicates the second adjacent; the predicate ‘existing³
