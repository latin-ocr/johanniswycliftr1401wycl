XLVI lNTRODUCTION.

it must be recollected that the predicate is true only of the whole
subJ'ect.

As for the question whether, when several agents work
together to produce the same effect, they are or are not all causes
of the effect, Wyclif says there are three answers, the second of
which he prefers. Fir-st: The last agent produces the effect, the
others only predisposing towards that last effect by the foregoing
ones. The last straw breaks the camel’s back. This, notwithstanding
the authority of the proverb, is a somevvhat exaggerated vieW.
Second: Whoever intends to make, or do a whole thing or action,
and makes or does a part thereof, makes or does it partially. This
is Wyclif’s view, fron] the standpoint of common sense. Third: The
last straw indeed breaks the camel’s back, but produces none of the
previous effects of fatigue. Wyelif also admits1 that where many
forces work together, they each produce the rnovement, though none
may be at work for the whole time. —- The whole of the rest of
the chapter2 is devoted to clearing away misconceptions, that can
arise only by confusing a collective with a distributive or uni-
versal subject.

Such is, briefly and imperfectly given, the synopsis of Logica
and the first two tractates of Logicae continuatio. ln one of the reports'
of the Wyclif Society, Dr. Furnivall sayS, quoting a letter of mine,
that Logica is the most generally interesting of Wyclif's pbilo-
sophical works. From my point of view, this would be true to a
certain extent, even of the present volume, but 1 meant specially
to allude to the two others that are forthcoming. I should very
much regret that a’ny reader should be disappointed with this volume,
and I am sure that any man who has studied Logic with real interest
will admire the keen thought, the acumen and depth of views, and
the quaint originality of our author.
