INTRonttCTloN. XXXV

Wyclif admits that ‘nothing³ was the matter out of which God made
the world.¹ But this expression does not necessarily imply that he
gives an entity to nothingness; and I have nowhere else seen, so
far as l can remember, that he understands it in this sense. Wyclif’s
fondness for out-of—the-way modes of expression may no doubt be
answerable for many opinions that have been ascribed to him.

Chap. Vl. Of tlte Particular *affirmative (p. 107—-114). I believe
the reader has been sufficiently edified as to the manner of analyzing
or of expounding propositions in the former chapters. ln future
therefore, we may set aside what relates to exposition, and confine
ourselves to matters of more general interest.

Wyclif here again continues to follow the plan already laid
down: proofs a priori, a posteriori, ab opposito and ex aequO, though
he scarcely bestows a sentence each on the two last. The most
important passage is on p. 109, where the signification of Being is
debated. Some only admit that the word applies to what exists
actually3 others extend it to all that is possible, and even beyond,
to whatever is intelligible in any way. Wyclif is of course of the
latter opinion, and points out that when we speak ofthe Impossible,
even to say: eThis impossible thing is impossible’, we cannot find
any other verb but to be, that expresses our meaning. Extending thus
the sense of to be, we can admit that <what will be an ass at one
tirne will be a man at another' (as to the body, of course); ‘the same
thing (h0c2) will be at such a time an ass, and at such another not
an ass’3 and at the latter time will differ from an ass, Translated
into modern language‚ this would perhaps become: lt is possible
that every atom that at one time makes up the body of a man will
at another form the body of an ass. lf there were no one in the
world but a pregnant woman, it would be true to say of her: CThis·
will be all men’3 but not: ‘All men will be this.²

If we consider3 a man receiving a quality more and more intense
until his death, we have an affirmation of being which co'i'ncides
with the very cessation of his actuality: another reason for affirming
that the sense of being should be extended. For, at the very moment
he is no more, he is as old as ever he will be.
