XXXVIII INTRODI‘C'I'ION.

the term Cmore³3 but some authors, instead of ‘only³, employ purely’
or ‘merely³, in order to avoid this sort of exposition. It is of great
importance whether the exclusive particle precedes or follows the
negative, as: <A is only not Β), and ‘A is not only Β).

Chap. X. Qf Exceptive Propositions (142—156). These are such
as contain an exceptive clause, indicated by an exceptive particle,
the place of which does not matter. All are universal, but some
negatively and some positively. They may be expounded by not or
by otlzer; but Wyclif points out cases in which the latter exposition
strains the sense very much.¹ — The variations that occur, and their
causes, are next enumerated. The proposition amounts to a universal
one,‘2 if the exception regards only a few singulars. <All men but A
and B are in Oxford: all men are in Oxford.³ It is what modern
scholastics would call an imperfect universal. We may make any
proposition perfectly true by excepting the cases in which it is not
true, whether those cases exist or not. And this is not superfluous3
at least not more so than many other modes of expression now
employed. Note that the exceptive, ‘Every A but Β is C³‚ and its
prejacent, ‘Every A is C³, are subcontraries in the sense that both
may be false and both true. It may be denied that there is any
opposition between them, as in the case when the predicate is parti· ,
cular; as: ‘A man does not see a man except himself? but we must
take it to mean: Any man3 and then the proposition is universal:
otherwise it is not exceptive. Or, if it be urged that we can say,
‘Everybody except Socrates, is excepted3 so here the prejacent (Every-
body is excepted) comes to the same as the whole proposition, and
there is no contrariety: Wyclif answers that the proposition, as it
stands, contradicts itself.

We ought to expound certain exceptive propositions by the
idea of plurality. ‘I have given none save 4,' means εΙ have given 4,
and not more.’ But we have an impossible conclusion, if we expound
this by tnot anything else than 43³ or by ‘not —— not four'. For we
have given 1, 2, and 3 before giving the unit that makes four. This
part of the subject closes with some notes about the supposition of
exceptive terms.
