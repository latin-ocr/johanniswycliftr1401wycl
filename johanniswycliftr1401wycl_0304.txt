expounding3 1St, when the latter term
compared comprises an infinite multi-
tude, none of which is supreme, ila,-
such comparisons are impossible, for the
equality implies that one must be
supreme, 219; 21151, when the aforesaid
comparison is modified by the com-
parative degree (negation of equality)
and dii‘l'erence os time, 2203 those who
admit the theory of indivisible parts
making up the Continuous will admit
that a supreme degree must exist, 220;
how to expound a proposition in the
comparative, 2213 comparison is im-
possible unless both terms compared
really have 1110 531110 quality, 2223 how

differences between the comparative
and the superlative, ib.‚- all the signs

following terms distributive, 2253 ex-
ceptions to this rule, ib.; a peculliarity
about the distribution of the term that
follows the superlative, 226: mutual
exposition of comparatives, ib.; it is
not useless, since one proposition 15
put for another, and explains its sense,
