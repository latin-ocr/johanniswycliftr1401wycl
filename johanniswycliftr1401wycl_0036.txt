but mutually exclusive categories of Action and Passion, answering
to that by which the change is produced, and to the change itself
as produced. If a fixed state, it either abstracts from space and time,
and is then called Relation; or from space alone, and then takes
the name of Quana'aliyf (qztand0,1ime) or from time alone, or from
neither. If it abstracts from time alone and not from space, it
either relates only to a certain part of space, and is Locality; or it
refers to other bodies existing in space, and in that connection is
called Position. If the attribute includes both space and time, it is
a mere extrinsical denomination, and no name can be found for it
but Belonging. Thus, in the idea of an armed man, the attribute of
defence exists not in itself, but in the man and in the arms, it is
a state that requires certain conditions to be complied with. The
man must at a given time have a certain fixed spatial relation of
proximity with his arms. And thus we see the whole of the categories
accounted for, mutually exclusive, and together inclusive of all that
can bear the name of Being.

VVhether Aristotle understood the completeness of his own
categories, we need not examine. He indeed does not enter into any
proof that they are complete. ssut of all men Aristotle is the most
given to putting into practice the maxim: Intelligenti pauca. He
writes neither for cavillers nor for fools, but for quick-witted

Chap. IV. lee First Principle (p. 13). In each predicament
there is one first principle of all. We may pass over the enumeration
of those first principles, except those of locality and time. The
mathematical point, says Wyclif, is the first principle of the former3
the indivisible instant, that of the latter. This by itself may be
understood in a manner that has nothing origina13 but he goes on
to say that the whole world is made up of points, and time like-
wise ofindivisible instants. <Totus situs mundi componitur ex sitibus
punctalibus . . . Sicut mundus componitur ex punctalibus‚ sic tempus
componitur ex instantibus.³ What is more, as we shall see in' another
volume of this work, the points are “immediata³, i. e. touch one
another, and the instants follow one another directly; yet, though the
former have no size, they make up lines, surfaces and volumes by
their contact; and though the latter have no duration whatever, they
