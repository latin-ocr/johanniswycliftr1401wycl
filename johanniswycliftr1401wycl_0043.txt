allusions¹ to something very like it. It is necessary to say some-
thing of this.

(ι.) Α proposition the supposition of whose subject is distri-
butive (All men are mortal) is analyzed into its component parts by
enumerating each of the singularS, repeating the verb and predicate
after eaclz, and joining each of the propositions by and. This is
called the copulative descent. Ex: The man A is mortal‚ and the
man Β is mortal‚ and ..... the man Z is mortal All men
are mortal. The whole of the component propositions together make
up the universal one.

(2.) A proposition the supposition of whose subject is collective
(all the Apostles are twelve) is analyzed to some extent into its
singulars by enumerating each singular that makes up the subject,
adding tlze verb and predicate once only, when the enumeration is
ended, having previously joined each singular term by and. This is
called the copulate descent. Ex: Peter, and James, and Matthew . . . .
and Judas Iscariot are twelve All the Apostles are tzvelve. It is
seen that there is in reality but one proposition here: analysis only
separates the singular parts of the subject.

(3.) Aproposition the supposition of whose subject is indefinite
(Some men are slaves) is analyzed into its singulars by enumerating
all of them, adding tlze verb and predicate aster each, and j0ining
every one of these new propositions by or. This is called the dis-
junctive descent. Ex: Either the man A is a slave, or the man Β
is a slave, or . . . . or the man Z is a slave Some men are slaves.
The whole of the singular propositions together make up the
particular one.

(4.) A proposition the supposition of whose subject is confused
(Some craft is necessary for seafaring) is to some extent analyzed
into its singulars by enumerating all the singulars of its subject, and
adding the verb and predicate at tlze close oftlze enumeration, having
previously joined each of the singulars by or. This is called disjunet
descent. Ex: The craft A, or the craft Β, or the craft C . . . or
the craft Z is necessary for seafaring Some craft is necessary
