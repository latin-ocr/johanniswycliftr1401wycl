XII INTRODUCTlON.

better, have been disgusted with it, on account of its heathenish
technical expressions. So Ι propose to give proofs of propositions
that shall be taken from Scripture. After the study of terms and
their properties‚ of universals and categories‚ Ι shall take up pro-
positions‚ the various descriptions of argument, and lastly examine
the subject of knowledge.²³

We ma}v here notice by-the-by‚ that the last promised head is
nowhere to be found in this abstract3 nor indeed is anything
corresponding to it met with anywhere else. If we remark that the
last example given,¹ concerning the logical exercise called obligation‚
breaks off suddenly without any solution of the difficulty, we may
infer that possibly there is here something wanting; perhaps more
than a whole chapter. There is, however, only one blank line on
the MS. A between the last words of the Abstract, quam Petrus, and
the first ones of the Continuatio: Juvenum rogatibus.

Chap. Ι (p. 2—8) deals with Terms, and contains a full but
concise summary of their different classifications and subclassificationS.
We may say a word about resoluble, exponible and official term5‚
as they frequently occur further on; and also about terms of the
first and second intention and imposition, as these expressions are
very little used at the present day, and liable to be confusing. In
eA man is mort-dP, man is a resoluble term, because it can be ana-
lyzed into its singulars: the man A is mortal; the man Β ditt03
and so on. In ‘Man alone is ration-211³, alone is an exponible term,
becauseits sense can be expounded in two propositions, cMan is rafional’,
and tWhat is not man is not rational³. An official term in a propo-
sition posits that proposition as an act of the mind or will: as
‘1 know that l exist’3 i. e. ‘The proposition, J exist, is known by
nie'. As it was believed that the first intention or act of the mind
concerns the objects themselves, without any reflection upon their
universality or particularity, all such objects belong to the first
intention, as: God, angel, man, etc.; while the reflection upon the
degree of universality or particularity of these objects constitutes the
second intention3 as when we say: Man is a species, Angel is a
genus. this man, that angel are individual beings. Here species,
